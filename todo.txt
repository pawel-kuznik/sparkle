-   Should List accept a query select in add() method? To place the component in a specific place in the list markup.
-   Create a component-managed list of DOM handlers? This way they could be cleaned when the component is uninstalled.
-   Component.remove() should also terminate any template loading process and put the object in inert state.
-   Create a router? This was solved so many times. Is there a point of having a custom router?
